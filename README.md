# s14l - Name Shortener

## Description
A simple tool that shortens names by taking the first letter, counting non-whitespace characters, and appending the last letter.

For example: "John Doe" becomes "j5e" when running:
```
s14l.py "John Doe"
```
...or (if your python is somewhere else than /usr/bin/python), use this:

```
python s14l.py "John Doe"
```
...or even:
```
<full path to python> s14l.py "John Doe"
```
